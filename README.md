# garlib

**The oversell:**

A general multi-purpose, Swiss Army Knife, Jack of all trades, one-stop shop, janitor's keyring, one size fits all, encyclopedic compendium, turnkey solution for your every possible JavaScript desire!

**The undersell:**

It's a modest collection of JS/TS helpers and utilities gathered into one place. Sort of a "poor man's Lodash," although it would have to be _very_ poor in this case, since Lodash is already very free.

Let's put it this way: you may find something of use here, but you may also _not_ find something of use here. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Usage

- Install with `yarn add @gargrave/garlib` (or the `npm` variant if you prefer)
- Import what you need, and starting benefitting greatly

## Docs

No docs yet! I will work on these at some point in near-ish future, but for now this is a very small, new package, so I am not overly concerned about it yet.
